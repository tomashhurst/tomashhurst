I am a Senior Cytometry Scientist with the <a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a> and an Honorary Research Fellow in <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school/discipline-of-infectious-diseases-and-immunology.html">infectious disease and immunology</a> at the University of Sydney. In these roles I specialise in the use of cutting edge high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and spatial multiomics technologies for interrogating cellular systems. My work involves the development of new computational and experimental methods to better understand immune development and pathology across the human lifespan, with a particular interest in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory and neuroinvasive infectious diseases. I co-lead the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/our-research/integrative-systems-and-modelling/single-cell-biology.html">Single Cell and Spatial Biology Research Node</a> of the Charles Perkins Centre and am an active member of the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/infectious-diseases-institute/">Sydney Infectious Disease Institute</a>.

I received my Ph.D in Medicine (Immunology) from the University of Sydney, where I used Australia's first mass cytometry system to discover a role for inflammatory haematopoiesis in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis. Subsequently I served as a high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility, and held visiting scientist positions with Stanford University and the Francis Crick Institute in London. Across these roles I developed and implemented multiple new techniques for cytometry, single-cell, and spatial analysis, helping to discover key determinants of host protection and pathology in important diseases including COVID-19.
